**Exploring the AI Landscape** is a blog engaging with diverse topics in artificial intelligence, from basic research to product trends and deployment. 

**By Brandon Yang and Maithra Raghu.** We first met as researchers at Google Brain in Mountain View. We started _Exploring the AI Landscape_ as a joint project to craft a broad perspective on the field of AI and identify interconnected trends and challenges. (And build our friendship!) Topics we aim to write about include fundamental research papers, machine learning systems, AI in healthcare, human interaction with AI systems, and recent market trends.
